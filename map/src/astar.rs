/// AStar is an implementation of the A* search algorithm, commonly used for finding the shortest path
/// in a weighted graph.
///
/// The algorithm maintains a priority queue of paths while exploring the graph, expanding paths in
/// order of their estimated total cost from the start node to the goal node, factoring in both the
/// cost so far and an estimated cost (heuristic) to the goal.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `starting_point` - The initial tile where the search begins.
/// * `predicate` - A function that determines if a tile should be considered for further exploration.
///                 For instance, it might return `true` for passable tiles and `false` for obstacles.
/// * `cost` - A function that takes two tiles (fromTile, toTile) as input and returns the cost
///            of moving from 'fromTile' to 'toTile' as a Float. This allows for flexible cost
///            calculations based on different criteria, such as distance, terrain, or other
///            custom logic defined by the user.
/// * `heuristic` - A function that estimates the cost from a given tile to the goal. For the A*
///                 algorithm to guarantee the shortest path, this heuristic must be admissible,
///                 meaning it should never overestimate the actual cost to reach the goal.
///                 You can set this to `|_, _| 0.0` for Dijkstra's algorithm.
