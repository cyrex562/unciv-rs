# Development Notes

## Ideas

* Instead of unit and map_unit there should be a single unit component, whose position is tracked
* Automation should be a component with sub-components, not one unique Automation class per thing.
* Make the actions/phases of a turn a generic list of things to do that can be added on / modified over time.
* Experiment with various data structs for storing map info.
